## ⚡ Mr. Duracell — Charging Through Code

Hi, I’m Dimitar — known online as **Mr. Duracell**. I don’t build toy projects. I build production-ready tools that run fast, scale, and break norms.

### 💻 Full Stack & Beyond
- **Backend:** C# (.NET Core), Python (Flask), Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript
- **Desktop:** PyQt6 GUI apps with integrated Selenium, Pandas, and Excel automation
- **Web3:** Solana SDK, Raydium, Phantom, on-chain minting and liquidity logic (see [MintSec](https://mintsec.xyz))
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL
- **Automation:** PowerShell, Bash, py2exe, CI/CD deployment
- **Security Projects:** Keyloggers, TCP proxies, scanners, phishing tools (red team experience)

### 🛠️ Code With Purpose
I’ve built:
- A full **crypto launchpad** with token revocation & liquidity pools
- A **GUI scraper EXE** with automatic dependency resolution via PowerShell
- A **student management system** with full DB support
- Lightweight malware PoCs and network utilities for educational use

### 🧠 Mindset
- Certified in cybersecurity fundamentals (Sec+ in progress)
- Learning Rust & Anchor to expand Solana contracts
- Always building, always shipping

> I don’t just use technology — I master it, automate it, and push it until it bends.
